This Repository deals with the following challenges
1. Computer Vision
2. Pattern Recognition
3. Neural network
4. Convolutional Neural network
5. Data Processing
6. Data Classification
7. Supervised Learning

My Favorite NoteBooks are,
1. MNIST Digits CNN // deals with classifying images containing numbers to digits with 2 varieties of ML model { 1. Purely Linear NN & 2.Convolutional Neural Network (with 98.91% accuracy)}
2. Fashion MNIST CNN // deals with classifying clothes into 10 Categories. comprising of 3 ML models {1. Purely linear NN, 2. Linear NN with activation applied, 3. Convolutional NN (with ~90% accuracy)} Upon reviewing the models performance it was visible the the Fashion_MNIST dataset contained some wrong labeling, especially with the Shirts(full-sleeves) & T-shirts(Sleeves-till shoulders)

the REPO overall uses 
1. PyTorch + PyTorch NN + PyTorch torch-Vision + PyTorch datasets + Pytorch Transforms
2. Matplotlib (pyplot)
3. Numpy & Pandas
4. OpenCV or cv2
